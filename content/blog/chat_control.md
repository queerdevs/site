## Introduction

Chat Control is a not so new proposal by the EU Commission. It was prevented a couple years ago, but now is on the table again. This is really bad.  

Chat Control wants to use AI, to classify unwanted material. The justification for this is to stop the spread of CSAM. However, it only a matter of time, that this law will be used to also classify "extremist content", which is a translation for all opinions that question the capitalist hegemony of the European Union. If you want to know more about this, here is a [really good article about the newly proposed chat control](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/08/chat-control-must-be-stopped/). I hope we all know that this is not about preventing CSAM. If anyone questions this, there should be a central database storing CSAM to train the ai, which is bad and dangerous on **EVERY FUCKING LEVEL**.

In short, the European Union wants to read all your chats, including those you use for organizing.

## The problem for Organizations

Many organizations use [Signal](https://signal.org/) for organizing. While it might have been the only sane option, that was [a bad idea from the get go](https://dessalines.github.io/essays/why_not_signal.html). Unfortunately Chat Control makes it so much worse.

To find a possible solution, we need to dissect what chatrooms are usually used for in organizations.
