## Introduction

Chat Control is a not so new proposal by the EU Commission. It was prevented a couple years ago, but now is on the table again. This is really bad.  

Chat Control wants to use AI, to classify unwanted material. The justification for this is to stop the spread of CSAM. However, it only a matter of time, that this law will be used to also classify "extremist content", which is a translation for all opinions that question the capitalist hegemony of the European Union. If you want to know more about this, here is a [really good article about the newly proposed chat control](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/08/chat-control-must-be-stopped/).

In short, the European Union wants to read all your chats, including those you use for organizing.
