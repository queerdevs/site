## Introduction

Chat Control is a not so new proposal by the EU Commission. It was prevented a couple years ago, but now is on the table again. This is really bad.  

Chat Control wants to use AI, to classify unwanted material. The justification for this is to stop the spread of CSAM. However, it only a matter of time, that this law will be used to also classify "extremist content", which is a translation for all opinions that question the capitalist hegemony of the European Union. If you want to know more about this, here is a [really good article about the newly proposed chat control](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/09/08/chat-control-must-be-stopped/). I hope we all know that this is not about preventing CSAM. If anyone questions this, there should be a central database storing CSAM to train the ai, which is bad and dangerous on **EVERY FUCKING LEVEL**.

In short, the European Union wants to read all your chats, including those you use for organizing.

## The problem for Organizations

Many organizations use [Signal](https://signal.org/) for organizing. While it might have been the only sane option, that was [a bad idea from the get go](https://dessalines.github.io/essays/why_not_signal.html). Unfortunately Chat Control makes it so much worse.

To find a possible solution, we need to dissect what chatrooms are usually used for in organizations.

## Dissecting the use of chatrooms

The first obvious use of chatrooms is, keeping your comrades and community updated. If you have organized a protest, or some new legislation caused your train station to now be surveiled using cameras, or anything else, you might want to alert your comrades and community. Fortunately this usually doesn't transmit non public data. 

The other more difficult use is organizing. Obviously most organizing should be done in person, but sometimes it just is not easily doable without eating up all resources you have. Examples might be finding times where you could hold a plenary, or voting on designs. This is very confidential information and should NEVER be surveiled by anyone. Chatrooms are never perfectly safe for that, but Chat Control makes them completely unsafe.

[Signal already strongly spoke out against Chat Control](https://archive.is/molDG)

> Let’s be very clear, again: mandating mass scanning of private communications fundamentally undermines encryption. Full stop. Whether this happens via tampering with, for instance, an encryption algorithm’s random number generation, or by implementing a key escrow system, or by forcing communications to pass through a surveillance system before they’re encrypted,

If Signal pulls out of the EU market will only tell the time. If they do an easy option would be to just sideload the app. But that has clear limitations. Comrades using an I-Phone couldn't use it, not everyone knows that, and it is not unlikely that Signal will just implement Chat Control. So regardless what Signal does, we need to be prepared. 

## Possible Solutions

**NOTE** Those are suggestions and have to be applied to your local structures.

We need to switch away from Signal. Unfortunately there is no convenient replacements for Signal. The best option would be [matrix](https://matrix.org/). However matrix has a lot of issues. For one it isn't as easy to use like signal is. The other issue is, that due to the federation a lot of metadata could leak. But matrix has one thing signal does not have. You can host it yourself. To not leak any metadata, you would have to turn of federation. Obviously most smaller organizations won't be able to host a matrix server themselves, so cooperation with a nearby hackspace could be livesaving there. If you are based in germany, there is [a list of leftist hackspaces on the website of the CCC](https://www.ccc.de/en/club/erfas).
